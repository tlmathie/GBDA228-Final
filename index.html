      <p> <strong>Hi, my name is Tatum Mathieu and this is my  website for GBDA 228.</strong> <br> I am a 19 year old girl from Ontario, Canada. I enjoy all things nature, being creative, going out with friends and living new experiences. I wanted to incorporate my hobbies and interests into a website to make this assignment fun for me! My color palette is neutrals, which I love, as well as blue and green, which are my favorite colors. With this website I want to achieve a style that fits with my personality and is also fun and professional. I chose to call my ‘blog’ Tatum's Garden Couture because two of my favorite things are plants and clothes/fashion along with other things I enjoy like the arts, specifically fine arts and music.

      <h2>ARTS</h2>
      
      <h4>CONCERTS</h4>
      
      <p>I love music, all kinds! I have seen many concerts. From Big Time Rush (the first time they were a band) to Slip Knot. From Mariah Carey to Noah Kahan. From The Killers to Billie Eilish. My concerts have no rhyme or reason, it just has to be something that sounds good to my ears. Music has always been something I used to connect with people, which is why I have been to so many concerts. I enjoy sharing that experience of seeing an artist you both like, it makes it feel like you are sharing something personal and special.</p>
      
      <h4>FINE ARTS</h4>
      
      <p>I just love all things creative and one of those things is fine arts. Whenever I visit my hometown of Sarnia, I try to make an effort to visit our local art gallery and see any new exhibits that they might have. Last year I visited the AGO (Art Gallery of Ontario). I also like to paint from time to time. Going to different galleries or seeing new exhibits helps me to think beyond my own creativeness. It’s interesting to see how people's brains interpret different feelings or sites. It can be quite inspiring.  I am no Monet but here are some pieces. </p>
