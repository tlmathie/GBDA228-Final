      <p><strong>Hi, my name is Tatum Mathieu and this is my website for GBDA 228.</strong> <br>
        I chose to do a blog. I wanted to incorporate my hobbies and interests into a website to make this assignment fun for me! My color palette is neutrals, which I love, as well as blue and green, which are my favorite colors. With this website I want to achieve a style that fits with my personality and is also fun and professional. I chose to call my ‘blog’ Tatum's Garden Couture because two of my favorite things are plants and clothes/fashion. I thought this was a cute title to incorporate that.</p>
